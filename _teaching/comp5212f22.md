## Announcements

## Description
In this course, we will cover some classifical and advanced algorithms in machine learning. Topics include: Linear models (linear/logistic regression, support vector machines), Non-linear models (tree-based methods, kernel methods, neural networks), learning theory (hypothesis space, bias/variance tradeoffs, VC dimensions). The course will also discuss some advanced topics of machine learning such as testing-time intergrity in trustworthy machine learning and neural architecture search in AutoML.
## Prerequisites
Basic knowledge in numerical linear algebra, probability, and calculus. 
## Grading Policy
- Homework (40%)
    - 3 Written homeworks
    - 2 Programming homeworks 
- Term project (35%)
- Final exam (25%)

## Late submission policy:
Late submissions are accepted up to 2 days after the due date, with 10% (of the total grade of the item) penalty per day.

## Term projects
Students will work on a open-topic research project with groups. Each group could only be consisted with less or equal than 4 members (<=4). Feel free to discuss with me offline for the topic choice.
